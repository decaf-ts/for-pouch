### Description

The `for-pouch` library provides a robust TypeScript adapter for PouchDB integration within the Decaf ecosystem. It builds upon the CouchDB adapter functionality to offer a specialized implementation tailored for PouchDB databases.

#### Core Components

- **PouchAdapter**: The central class that implements the Adapter interface for PouchDB. It provides methods for all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) with support for both single and bulk operations. The adapter handles the conversion between your application models and PouchDB documents, manages error handling, and implements PouchDB-specific functionality.

- **PouchRepository**: A type definition that combines the generic Repository with PouchDB-specific components. This provides a type-safe way to work with PouchDB databases using the repository pattern.

- **PouchFlags**: An interface that extends the base repository flags with PouchDB-specific properties, particularly the UUID for identifying users or operations.

- **PouchFlavour**: A constant that identifies the PouchDB implementation in the decorator system, allowing for targeted decorators specific to PouchDB adapters.

#### Key Features

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support ensures type safety throughout your application when working with PouchDB.

2. **Repository Pattern**: Implements the repository pattern for clean separation of data access logic from business logic.

3. **Bulk Operations**: Support for efficient bulk create, read, update, and delete operations.

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with specific error types for different scenarios (NotFoundError, ConflictError, etc.).

5. **Decorator Support**: Integration with the Decaf decorator system for enhanced functionality and metadata management.

6. **CouchDB Compatibility**: Built on top of the CouchDB adapter, maintaining compatibility with CouchDB features like Mango queries.

The library serves as a bridge between your TypeScript application models and PouchDB databases, providing a consistent and type-safe API for database operations while abstracting away the complexities of direct PouchDB interaction.
