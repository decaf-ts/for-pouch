# Decaf's PouchDB (CouchDB) Module

## Summary

The `for-pouch` library is a TypeScript adapter for PouchDB integration that provides a repository pattern implementation for working with PouchDB databases. It offers a type-safe interface for performing CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on PouchDB databases, with support for bulk operations, error handling, and custom decorators. The library extends the CouchDB adapter functionality to work specifically with PouchDB, providing a consistent API for database operations while maintaining TypeScript type safety throughout the application.
